# Automated Network Threat Detection and Analysis System
## Overview
This project implements an automated system for network threat detection and analysis using Python scripts, network monitoring tools, and AI-powered report generation. The system integrates Wireshark, TCPdump, Scapy, Nmap, and OpenAI's GPT-3 API to monitor network traffic, perform ethical hacking techniques, and generate detailed threat analysis reports automatically.

## Features
- *Network Monitoring:* Utilizes Wireshark and TCPdump for real-time network traffic capture and analysis.
- *Ethical Hacking:* Implements Python scripts for ethical hacking techniques such as brute-force password cracking and packet manipulation using Scapy.
- *Network Scanning:* Uses Nmap for network scanning to identify open ports and services.
- *Threat Analysis:* Integrates OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate detailed threat analysis reports based on collected data.
- *Automation:* Scripts can be scheduled via cron jobs or tasks for continuous monitoring and analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Wireshark
- TCPdump
- Scapy
- Nmap
- OpenAI GPT-3 API Key

## Installation
#### 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/automated-threat-detection.git
cd automated-threat-detection
```
#### 2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 3. Download rockyou.txt Password File
  
Download the rockyou.txt password file from the internet and place it in the project directory. You can find it [here](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt).
#### 4. Set up OpenAI API

Obtain your OpenAI GPT-3 API key and set it in the script.

## Usage
#### 1. Capture Network Traffic:

Start TCPdump to capture network traffic:
```
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w traffic_capture.pcap
```
#### 2. Run the Python Scripts:

Execute the main script to perform automated network scanning, ethical hacking techniques, and generate a threat analysis report:
```
python automated_threat_detection.py
```
#### 3. View Reports:

Generated reports will be stored in the `reports/` directory.
